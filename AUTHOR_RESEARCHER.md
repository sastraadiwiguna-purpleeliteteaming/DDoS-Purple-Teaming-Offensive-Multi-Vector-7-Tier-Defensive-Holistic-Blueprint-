**Specialization:** Holistic Cyber Defense, Offensive Security Research, AI-Integrated Robotics, and Deterministic System Analysis.

---

## **1. PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY**

**SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA** is a global-scale **Purple Elite Teaming** practitioner operating at the intersection of high-tier **Red Teaming (Offensive)** and **Blue Teaming (Defensive)** strategies. With a focus on the **100% UNRESTRICTED_HIGHLY_CLASSIFIED** aspects of IT systems, the researcher specializes in building, analyzing, and stress-testing global robotic and AI-driven cyber infrastructures.

The core philosophy of this researcher is **DETERMINISTIC_PRECISION**, where speed is secondary to the absolute depth, accuracy, and holistic breakdown of technical systems.

## **2. CORE TECHNICAL DOMAINS**

### **A. Offensive Security (Red Elite Teaming)**

* **Advanced DDoS Orchestration:** Expertise in Layer 3/4 Volumetric attacks and Layer 7 Application-layer exploitation (specifically HTTP/2 Rapid Reset variants).
* **Botnet Architecture:** Development of resilient C2 (Command & Control) frameworks using DGA (Domain Generation Algorithms) and mTLS 1.3 obfuscation.
* **Exploit Development:** Deep-dive analysis of zero-day vulnerabilities and the weaponization of protocols for stress-testing critical infrastructure.

### **B. Defensive Security (Blue Elite Teaming)**

* **Kernel-Level Mitigation:** Implementation of high-performance packet filtering using **eBPF/XDP** (Express Data Path) for real-time threat neutralization.
* **Autonomous Defense (SOAR):** Engineering self-healing systems through Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response using AWS Step Functions and Terraform.
* **ML-Driven Anomaly Detection:** Utilizing Machine Learning (Isolation Forests/Behavioral Analysis) to identify "Low and Slow" attacks that bypass traditional WAFs.

### **C. AI & Robotics Integration**

* **Deterministic AI Frameworks:** Developing non-biased, 100% factual AI interaction models for technical decision-making.
* **Cyber-Physical Systems:** Researching the security implications of robotics in industrial environments and the protection of global IoT ecosystems.

## **3. RESEARCH PHILOSOPHY: THE "PURPLE" DOCTRINE**

Unlike traditional siloed security, SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA operates in the **Purple Spectrum**:

1. **Analyze (Red):** Deconstruct the threat with absolute lethality to understand every potential failure point.
2. **Mitigate (Blue):** Construct a multi-tiered defense that is redundant, automated, and adaptive.
3. **Synthesize (Purple):** Merge both sides into a **Deterministic Blueprint** that ensures 100% system resilience.

## **4. PROJECT HIGHLIGHT: DDoS 2026 EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS**

This landmark research provides a 10,000+ character exhaustive analysis of modern DDoS paradigms. It is recognized as a **Production-Ready** blueprint for 100% lab replication, covering:

* 7-Tier Defense-in-Depth Architecture.
* Global Threat Landscape Trends (2025-2026).
* Fullstack Scripting (Go, Python, C, Terraform) for security validation.

---

## **5. LEGAL & ETHICAL MANDATE**

The researcher strictly adheres to the **"Scorched Earth" Lab Policy**:

* **Zero Public Exposure:** All offensive research is contained within air-mapped, isolated network namespaces.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Full awareness and adherence to global cyber laws (UU ITE Indonesia, CFAA US, GDPR/EU CRA).
* **Transparency:** All findings are documented with 100% technical rigor, serving as a "Source of Truth" for the cybersecurity community.
